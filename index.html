      <h1>Yamaha rx100</h1>
      <article>
          <p>Yamaha RX100: Young people like Yamaha bikes a lot, the main reason for this is that<br> 
              this bike looks very good and the features available in the bike are also amazing.</p>

          <h1>R15 V4</h1>
          <p>The R15 V4 comes with Traction Control System. This is a dedicated electronic system that has 
              the remarkable ability of reducing the chances of a spinning wheel.</p>
                              
          <h1>Master of Torque(MT)</h1>
          <P>The name MT itself is clear in defining the bike, which stands for Master of Torque. The naming of the MT series itself is used by
              Yamaha globally for naked sport motorbike products which are also used as the basis for the R series motorbikes in its class.</P>

          <h1>Yamaha XSR125</h1>
          <p>The fastest speed I managed to get out of this bike was an indicated 73 mph. That was full tuck on an A-road, and it didn't seem to want to go any faster. The good news is that again, thanks to the VVA,
             it can get there relatively quickly, so A-road riding is perfectly possible even if it is a little uncomfortable</p>

          <h1>FZS</h1>
          <p>In Yamaha motorcycles, the "FZ" typically refers to the model series or family of motorcycles. The FZ series from Yamaha is known for its sporty and versatile bikes.
             The "F" in FZ often stands for "Four-Stroke," indicating that these motorcycles are equipped with four-stroke engines.
            Each specific model within the FZ series may have additional letters or numbers that denote its particular variant or features. For example, 
            the Yamaha FZ-07 or FZ-09 are specific models within the FZ series, each with its own specifications, engine displacement, and design.</p>
